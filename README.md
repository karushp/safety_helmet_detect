This project was developed using the expertise gained from an intensive 9-week BootCamp at Le Wagon, Tokyo. 
More than 7500 images were trained on YOLO v8 over a total of 26 hours.
OpenCV and Streamlit were utilized for the final web application.

The model effectively detects individuals wearing safety helmets, aiming to enhance safety in the construction industry.
We hope this model will assist researchers in training on other safety measures 
such as gloves, glasses, and vests, ultimately helping to reduce workplace hazards.
